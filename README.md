# Calculator
Pocket Calculator for everyday use
# Overview
For this assignment, I worked with Claude to create an aesthetically pleasing calculator that is easy on the eyes, and natural to use. There are so many apps, products, and technologies that push to advance. However, sometimes these new and shinier buttons or feautures can be too complicated and overwelme the user. A calculator should be useful, identifiable, and easy to understand. It's important to be able to trust the calculator's functions and rely on its abilities.
# People
This calculator is desgined for the busy business individuals, the casual shoppers, and the on-the-go moms. This audience needs something quick, easy and accecable in order to perform basic math calculations in their everday lives.
# What I learned
Working with Claude, I learned how to ask AI more direct questions in order to help bring my vision to life. I wanted something that was pleasing to the eye, and yet simple enough so that the users know exactly what to press while using the calculator. Because of the contrast in colors, no information needs to be explaned to the user.
